title: Identifying “tentacles”
position: 10
---

In order to conduct conversations with stakeholders in the system, you need to identify all key players related to [the process in scope]. There are two types of key players with what we think of as "tentacles" somehow touching the service your project aims to improve:

* **Those whose work is involved in the process**

* **Those whose work impacts the process**

Those involved in the process are usually pretty easy to spot; they’re closely involved with the process so their tentacle is pretty short. When you ask staff who are key players involved in [the process in scope], these are the groups you’ll hear first. On the other hand, those impacting the process are more indirectly involved, so their tentacle is much longer. You’ll need to specifically ask who impacts the process to identify them. Those with long tentacles are often overlooked because they don’t seem to own the process or manage it on a daily basis. Yet, they are still very important and should be engaged as key players.

*Considerations:*

* Snowball sampling will come in handy here. That method not only helps you identify all obvious key players, it also leads you to groups and staff who are more hidden in the system.

* Look through your notes from project planning and introduction conversations. Staff likely identified key players in your conversations. Reach out and ask them for an introduction!

* Reach out to your highly engaged, your "sneezers!" Ask them for their help reviewing your identified groups so far and suggest ones you’ve missed. In enlisting their help, you are engaging them as forces of good on the project and showing your respect for their expertise.
