You are well on your way to creating enduring transformation, in collaboration with a diverse array of key players by your side. Our goal with this guide is to share the strategies and approach that have worked for us at the Austin Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellowship. And we hope, spark additional conversations on how to further refine and develop this approach to meet the ever-evolving needs of whole-system transformation. Innovating products and services is a tall order, and we believe that focusing on the people who make that innovation happen is the key to success.
