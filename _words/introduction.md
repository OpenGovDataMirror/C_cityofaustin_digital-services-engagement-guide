## How to bring together city staff to tackle large-scale innovation

Looking to tackle large-scale innovation? The Austin Design, Technology, and Innovation Fellow Engagement Guide is for anyone seeking to make enduring transformation at a large-scale. From our experience designing and implementing multi-stakeholder collaboration processes in both public and private organizations, we’ve developed strategies for navigating the complex human dimension of large-scale innovation. We’ve tested these strategies in our own work partnering with City of Austin staff to improve services for residents. While this guide is targeted specifically at civic design teams who partner with city staff to improve city services, we’ve also found these strategies to be helpful for engaging cross-functional teams and large, bureaucratic organizations in general.

Questions, comments, feedback? Let’s have a conversation. Email us at [innovation@austintexas.gov](mailto:innovation@austintexas.gov).
