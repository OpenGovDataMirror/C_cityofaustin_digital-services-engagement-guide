Your conversations with system stakeholders include all the elements and guidance laid out in our general considerations, plus:

* **Introductions**
  * **You** - Learn how they are connected to [the process in scope].
  * **Project** - Learn their current understanding of the project. Share your team’s starting point and current status
	* *Sample script*
    * "We appreciate that it takes a number of city departments and working groups to make the [process in scope] run smoothly. So we’re trying to connect with all groups who are involved or impact the process to share with them about the project and learn what resonates from this project with their needs...We’d also like to share the groups we’ve identified so far to see if you think we’re missing any."
* **Expectations** - Share the scope of the project, the role that other groups besides [the partnering organization] can play in the project, and opportunities to serve in advisory or project champion roles.
